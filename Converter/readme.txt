Problem: Problem Three: Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy

I essentially started off by creating my solution in visual studios. I created the solution structure then began with writing out the tests.

My goal then was to make a roman numeral conversion program to simplify the solution before I adapted it to fit the specifics of the problem itself e.g. the alien language and material values.

I created the tests and made the roman numeral application then I modified it to fit the specifics of the problem itself.

Assumption:
The solution didn’t need to convert the other direction e.g. “850 credits will buy you tegj silver”

I would have added dependency injection as a base to the solution but I didn’t want to add any extra libraries to conform to the rules of the problem.

I also would remove the dictionaries where I am storing the the material values and translations to either a database or a completely different solution so those can be updated without having to rebuild the solution.
